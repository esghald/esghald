- 👋 Hi, I’m @esghald
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding as a whole. I like to be the one knowing how things work under the hood.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and at the same time progressing through the Odin project.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet. Need to get a feel for things.
- 📫 How to reach me right now here. In the future I'll add some channels.
